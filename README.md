Tello Project:

A repository where I store the code I created and used while exploring drone technology.

Description:

This is a summer project I started working on in 2024. The main objective was to learn more about drones and their programming. I focused on understanding tracking software and its applications in real-world scenarios.

Usage Instructions:

Ensure you have a Python compiler installed on your system.
Obtain a Tello drone.
I recommend downloading the official Tello app to get the drone set up.
Download the Haar cascades for object tracking from OpenCV:
    https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades.

Features and Technology Stack:
    
Tracking Software: Haar cascades (provided by OpenCV).

Drone Control Library: djitellopy, used to interface with the Tello drone and implement custom commands.

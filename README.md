Tello_Project

A place where I'm storing all the code I used and created during the process of learning this type of technology.

DESCRIPTION:

This is a summer project I started working on in 2024. The main objective of this project was to learn more about drones and how to code with them.
I wanted to explore tracking software and its applications for a project like this.

USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:

To use my code, you only need a Python compiler and a Tello drone. I recommend downloading the Tello app first to get the drone working.
Also, download Haar cascades from opencv,This is the tracking software I used.

FEATURES AND TECHNOLOGY STACK:

I used OPENCV harrcascades tracking softwar.
Libaries that I used djitellopy to get the Tello drone to work.
